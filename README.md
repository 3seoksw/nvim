# My Neovim Config Files

### *NOTE*
As of 30DEC22, I am moving to [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org).  
My config files for lvim will be uploaded on my github repository.  

I gave up setting up java lsp (jdtls) so please be aware of it.  
Seems like jdtls isn't stable as expected so it's just painful setting up for java development.  

### Try this config
This `main` branch is the current config setup so you can simply copy them and use it!

***Up to 30DEC22***
