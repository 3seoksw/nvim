# Neovim Setup Tutorial

This will be an intro for neovim setup from the scratch, and my configs are written in lua file.  
It may seem a little complicated and hard, but if you keep up with the instructions, you will get along!  

The following tutorial will contain multiple chapters by branches so check it out.

## 01-Options
Since we are going to use neovim, we first need to set some fundamental options for neovim.

For these options, it's totally up to you based on your preference so please set the options and use my `options.lua` as a reference.
